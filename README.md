# Concrete Crack Image Classification using TensorFlow

## 1. Summary
The aim of this project is to create a model that can perform image classification on concrete crack images.

## 2. IDE and Frameworks used
The project is built using Spyder and Visual Studio Code for the python (.py) and jupyter notebook (.ipynb) respectively. 

The python packages used in this project is TensorFlow, Matplotlib, NumPy, Scikit-learn and Pandas.

## 3. Methodology

### 3.1 Datasets

The dataset contains concrete images having cracks. The data is collected from various METU Campus Buildings.
The dataset is divided into two as 'Negative' and 'Positive' crack images for image classification. 
Each class has 20000 images with a total of 40000 images with 227 x 227 pixels with RGB channels. The [dataset](https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/5y9wdsg2zt/2) was obtained from Data Mendeley. The sample of the datasets are shown below:
